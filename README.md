# Birder deployed on Render

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/render-examples/fastai-v3, a bear classification app. All I have done is change variables as per instructions at https://course.fast.ai/deployment_render.html.

It makes the model trained on the NABirds dataset (see https://github.com/walterlsb/birder-cnn) and makes it available as a web application for categorization.
